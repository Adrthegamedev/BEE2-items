Use these to make your own music track labels for UCPs.

The font used for official labels is "DIN Medium" with hex code F2F2F2, size 36 pixels. Type in the text, add a shadow beneath it, then change the color of "template_label_back" to whatever you like.

Layer the "template_label_shading" image over the "template_label_back" image, then you are done!
