	"Description"	"Underground 1955 blue gel enrichment sphere. This is when they tested on astronauts and celebrity volunteers. Gel replaces faith plates. This decade used lots of green walls, and brown things. Modern items are brown in this style.\n\nNote: 1950s buttons are embedded and can conflict with things under them, and stairs are unpaintable, use alternate versions if this causes problems."

	"Description"	"Underground 1961 decomissioned enrichment sphere with vitrified doors, mysterious pipes, and lots of warning signs. This decade was not present in the original game, except for some decommision signs, which makes it a good choice for stange tests with new elements like Reflection Gel or Paint Fizzlers. Some more blue walls. Gel still replaces faith plates. Old cubes, droppers, buttons, fizzlers, etc. Modern elements are still brown."

	"Description"	"Underground orange gel enrichment sphere from 1975, now for testing homeless people in exchange for $60, This is when they started using more random colours and materials on their walls, and ceilings are different. Elements are now made of yellow plastic, and buttons are no longer recessed into holes in the floor. Modern white indicator signs are starting to be used. Lights are now white, and the fog is grey. They still use gel instead of faith plates, and all other items are still old-style. The glass looks better, and stairs are no longer made of grating."

	"Description"	"Underground white gel enrichment sphere from 1985, now for testing employees. This is when they started using black and white surfaces, so there's now black stone and white concrete, in addition to some old style walls. \n- This is also when they started working heavily on robots, so turrets look modern. \n-Elements are now made of white plastic, and as seen on the signs, there's modern cubes (from old droppers), prototypes of modern buttons (except pedestal buttons), and almost modern indicators (except for the corners). \n-Lights are white and the fog is blue. \n-They still use gel instead of faith plates, and all other items are still old-style."
