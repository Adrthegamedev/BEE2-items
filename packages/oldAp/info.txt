	"Description"	"Underground 1955 blue gel enrichment sphere. This is when they tested on astronauts and celebrity volunteers. Gel replaces faith plates. This decade used lots of green walls, and brown things. Modern items are brown in this style. Note: 1950s buttons are embedded and can conflict with things under them, and stairs are unpaintable, use alternate versions if this causes problems."
