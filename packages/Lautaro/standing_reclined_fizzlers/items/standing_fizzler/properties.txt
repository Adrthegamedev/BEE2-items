	"Description"
		{
		"" "It is a Fizzler in standing position which is supported by 4x1x1 sized blocks. This makes it very much practical since you do not have to add blocks at each side just to support their frames." 
		"" ""
		"" "* It can be placed in 8 different positions like a light strip."
		"" "* To produce other types of fizzlers, connect this to a copy of the relevant fizzler."
		"" "* It can be resized up to 5 levels by using the Cube Type property."
		"" "* Each pillar will match the colour of the surface it is mounted on." 
		"" "* If any of the pillars are inside of a block, that pillar will not be generated to avoid texture overlaps."
