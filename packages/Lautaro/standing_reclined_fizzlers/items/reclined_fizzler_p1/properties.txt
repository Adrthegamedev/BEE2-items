"Description"
{
"" "A Reclined Fizzler that can be resized to cover up to 3 surfaces. Useful when you want to place the Fizzler to cover withe surfaces without having to add annoying blocks at each side of the Fizzler just to support their frames."
"" ""
"" "* It behaves identical to the vanilla Fizzler."
"" "* Each pillar will match the colour of the surface it is mounted on."  
"" "* If any of the pillars are inside of a block, that part of the pillar will not be generated to avoid texture overlaps."
