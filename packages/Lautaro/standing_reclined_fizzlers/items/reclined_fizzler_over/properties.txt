"Description"
{
"" "A Reclined Fizzler. It is useful for certain scenarios where you want to place the Fizzler to cover the face a white block without having to add annoying blocks at each side of the Fizzler just to support it."
"" ""
"" "* It behaves identical to the vanilla Fizzler."
"" "* Each pillar will match the colour of the surface it is mounted on."  
"" "* If any of the pillars are inside of a block, that pillar will not be generated to avoid texture overlaps."
