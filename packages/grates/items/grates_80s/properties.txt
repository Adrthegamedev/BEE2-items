"Description"
{   
"" "A set of three grates to be used in Coop maps that prevents cubes from being passed through them."
"" ""
"" "Available in three different sizes:"
"" ""
"" "* 128x128."
"" "* 128x256."
"" "* 128x128 Reclined."
"" ""
"" "TIP: If the Grate is covering a white wall, use __Light Strips__ around it since the Grate will cast a small shadow."
"" "> IMPORTANT NOTE:"
"" ""
"" "* If the Grate is rotated with the adjustment tool so that it's facing a white wall, then Funnels, Light Bridges, Lasers, Fizzlers and Gels can go through it without problems."
"" "* If the Grate is NOT facing a white wall, almost mentioned items can go through exepting Funnels and Light Bridges."
"" "* Almost Gel Flows can go through, exept Bombs."
"" "* This item is not supposed to replace the original Grating entirely, yet it can be used alongside it to supply each other deficiencies."
