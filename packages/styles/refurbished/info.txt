		{
			"Line"   "This style is a hybrid Old Aperture/Clean style. It uses an old enrichment sphere which has been upgraded by GlaDOS. Vactubes fill the area above the sphere, and all items invented after 1950 (other than gel and paint fizzlers) use the fully modern versions."
			"Bullet" "Cameras are dotted around the sphere."
			"Bullet" "Modern items are mounted on small sections of clean wall, sticking into the chamber slightly."
			"Bullet" "Panel or piston related items use modern panels/pistons, attached to old walls or grating."
			"Bullet" "Items that were in the original underground maps (like Flip Panels, normal floor buttons, emancipation fields) appear identical to 1950s versions."
