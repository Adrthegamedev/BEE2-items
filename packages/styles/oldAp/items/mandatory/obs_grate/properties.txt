	"Description"	"A grating showing the surrounding Enrichment Sphere. This is always placed by default in a map, and produces special lighting that casts real-time shadows.  

If multiple are placed in the map, all but one are converted to normal rooms (since the sphere cannot appear at multiple places)."
