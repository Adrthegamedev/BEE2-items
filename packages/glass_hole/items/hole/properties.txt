		"" "Allows cutting circular holes into Glass or Grating.  "
		"" "* Place on top of an existing glass/grating surface. (Place onto wall to rotate, then drag onto the glass.)"
		"" "* For large holes, glass must also be present above, below, left and right."
		"" "* Small holes allow portal shots, bullets, lasers and paint splatter. Large holes allow anything through."
		"" "* This also works with grating, although it is less useful."
